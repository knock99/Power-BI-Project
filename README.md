# Power-BI-Project :bar_chart:

## Overview
This project shows the comparison of two NHL players Dylan Larkin and Pierre Luc Dubois. Theyre both centres and close in age and with Dubois due for a contract I decided to compare some stats of the two. Larkin having recieved a contract of 8.7 million per for 8 years I wanted to see if Dubois would be deserving of the same or higher contract. I compared them over the passed four seasons in ice time, games played,primary assists,points,goals, penalties drawn vs penalties taken, and corsi percentage(measures shot attempt differential while at even strength play).

## Results 
The results were Larkin leading marginally in most categories but Dubois was very close. Also considering Dubois being almost 2 years younger this is very impressive. The data shows that Dubois will likely demand a very similar salary and could possibly given more depending on the market for that calibre of player.
